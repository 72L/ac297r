<p>Tools that augment official health agency reports with media data (social media in addition to traditional news media) to track the progression of a disease have been extremely valuable to epidemiologists. Our collaborators at Healthmap have developed a successful organization committed to providing up-to-date visualizations and compilations of media alerts for diseases such as Dengue fever and the flu. We contributed to three major areas of Healthmap. Firstly, we create an automatic tagging tool that organizes incoming media alerts by disease and location, easing the burden on human alert curation. Secondly, we explore novel ways to model the number of cases of a disease over time, improving their prediction so that hospitals can prepare healthcare resources in advance. We show that our tagging and prediction methods improve upon reasonable baselines by at least 10%. Lastly, we build a map and a timeline visualization that allows users to explore and learn from media data in an interactive way. Our tools improve the Healthmap process so that media data can be even more useful to epidemiologists.</p>

<p>Healthmap (www.healthmap.org) is a collaboration between epidemiologists and computational scientists to track in real-time ongoing outbreaks of major diseases [1]. The projects emphasize the use of media data as well as official health agency reports. We use the term “media” broadly to refer to social media in addition to traditional news media. Media provides real-time coverage of diseases around the world much more quickly than official health reports. For instance, the use of Twitter to predict the number of cases of flu in real-time has been well studied in academia [2-4].  </p>

<p>A variety of sub-projects at Healthmap include predicting disease case counts based on multiple data sources (i.e. Twitter, Google Flu Trends, insurance claims) as well as visualizing cases and reports of Dengue fever. Visualizations that show when and where diseases (or reports of diseases) happen are very useful retroactively and in real time. Tools that visualize curated media reports enable epidemiologists and hospitals to better understand how a disease develops and prepare healthcare resources or advise government interventions.</p>

<p>Our goal for this project was to contribute useful computational tools to the Healthmap effort. We identified three major areas of Healthmap that could be improved. Firstly, we create an automatic tagging tool that organizes incoming media alerts by disease and location. Secondly, we explore novel ways to model the number of cases of a disease over time, improving their prediction. Thirdly, we build a map and timeline visualization that allows users to explore and learn from media data in an interactive way.</p>

<p>Human curation is currently used to organize the massive amounts of public-health-related media data scraped from the web and obtained via news feed APIs. In order to place incoming media alerts on a visualization and make the data useful, the location and date of the event mentioned in the text must be determined, along with the relevant disease. While human curation can be very accurate, it is time intensive and expensive. Our first contribution is a piece of software that is able to perform labeling automatically using machine learning. We develop and test a novel algorithm that learns the relevant vocabulary and grammar of words that indicate the importance of a mentioned location. This automated pipeline can speed up the Healthmap data cleaning and organization process by replacing human curators or acting as a first-pass curation that can reviewed quickly and efficiently by humans. This enables epidemiologists to view and use data that is as most up-to-date as possible.</p>

<p>Our second contribution is an improvement upon current prediction techniques used in the field. This helps epidemiologists predict the number of cases of a particular disease so that they can advise government actions. In addition, healthcare workers can better prepare for patient influx when the prediction of case counts is accurate. We improve upon current predictive models and introduce a new hidden Markov model (HMM) that is based on epidemic modelling. These approaches are tested with a data set of Ebola-related Tweets and Ebola case/death data from the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>

<p>Our last contribution is a visualization that displays the Ebola media alerts on a map and a timeline, allowing epidemiologists to discover patterns in the data at a glance. Similar visualizations already exist in Healthmap; however, we take a fresh approach by implementing new, interactive features that furthers discovery through data exploration.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
