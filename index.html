<p>TTools that augment official health agency reports with media data (social media in addition to traditional news media) to track the progression of a disease have been extremely valuable to epidemiologists. Our collaborators at Healthmap have developed a successful organization committed to providing up-to-date visualizations and compilations of media alerts for diseases such as Dengue fever and the flu. We contributed to three major areas of Healthmap. Firstly, we create an automatic tagging tool that organizes incoming media alerts by disease and location, easing the burden on human alert curation. Secondly, we explore novel ways to model the number of cases of a disease over time, improving their prediction so that hospitals can prepare healthcare resources in advance. We show that our tagging and prediction methods improve upon reasonable baselines by at least 10%. Lastly, we build a map and a timeline visualization that allows users to explore and learn from media data in an interactive way. Our tools improve the Healthmap process so that media data can be even more useful to epidemiologists.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
